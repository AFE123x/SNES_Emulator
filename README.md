# SNES Emulator

## Introduction

This is my new SNES Emulator. I'll be writing it in C to brush up on C programming principles. My objective is to use sdl2 and multithreading. I wrote an NES Emulator in rust, but found that I was only tinkering 

## todo list

Current goals

- Read up on SNES Architecture in general
    - read up on the 65816 cpu (leave it at that)
